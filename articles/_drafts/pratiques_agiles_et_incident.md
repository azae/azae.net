# le contexte
Un client qui adopte un certains nombre de bonnes pratique agiles et qui constate une baisse significative des incidents

# Taxonomie des incidents et des demandes

## Root cause
* Software: bugs, malfunctions and configuration errors in applications.
* Firmware: bugs, malfunctions and configuration errors in firmware and operating systems of servers and network and security devices.
* Hardware: Malfunctions and errors in hardware, e.g. fans, CPU, memory, bus, cards, etc.
* Process: Poorly defined, implemented, communicated or supervised process, e.g. too loose change management process
* Human error: Something that was not intended by the actor thus causing the incident.
* Other: Any other root cause for the incident.
* Unknown: Root cause was not found or it was not analyzed

## Demandes

* Action
** Provisioning : User requires access to a service or part of a service, e.g. a security permission, a menu option, a token, a digital certificate, a client install, a desktop device, a phone, etc.
** Booking : Scheduled attendance at training, seminar, meeting, reservation of a resource, annual leave. 
** Ordering : Books, desks, catering, stationery, travel. 
** Change : as defined by change management, typically means change to a CI. Some organisations allow users to open RFCs directly, others have some form of prior request entity. 
** Work : tasks that falls outside change management. Run a report. Move a PC. Install a projector.
* Support
** Incident : an unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service. (Question: if an interruption or degradation of service is within the terms of the SLA, is it an Incident? ) 
** Fault : Failure or detected imminent failure of a CI, no service impact (yet). Only users within IT would be expected to report these, or an automated tool. If confirmed, it will spawn a Problem. (This was much debated recently. If you follow ITIL then an incident and a fault are the same thing.) 
** Help : Correcting data arising from user error (NOT from a Problem). Restoring a deleted file, untangling a mess... 
** Advice : How do I … ? Should I … ? Which is the best way to … ? 
* Input
** Proposal / Suggestion / Feedback
** Complaint
